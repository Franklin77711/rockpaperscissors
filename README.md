This Project is for the game Rock Paper Scissors (from now only RPS)  
I will style it with CSS, and i will try to add a basic UI to it aswell. In the first attempt i will me the fundational HTML, and CSS and move foward with the JS and optimalise it.  
AFTER FINISH:    
This project took around 5 hours to make. I needed a lot of googleing first but some of the parts was alone work aswell.  
I think the UI could be a lot better but for a first project with javascript it's an OK try in my opinion.  
Later on i might come back to this project to make it better.  
(the UI idea was mainly based on @michalosman -'s project.)
